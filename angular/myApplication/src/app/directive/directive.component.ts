 // Angular 8 directives can be classified in 3 categories based on how they behave:

//Component Directives
//Structural Directive
//Attribute Directives
//Component Directives: Component directives are used in main class.
// They contain the detail of how the component should be processed,
 // instantiated and used at runtime.

//Structural Directives: Structural directives start with a * sign. 
//These directives are used to manipulate and change the structure of the DOM elements.
 //For example, *ngIf directive, *ngSwitch directive, and *ngFor directive.

//*ngIf Directive: The ngIf allows us to Add/Remove DOM Element.

//*ngSwitch Directive: The *ngSwitch allows us to Add/Remove DOM Element.
// It is similar to switch statement of C#.

//*ngFor Directive: The *ngFor directive is used to repeat a portion of HTML
// template once per each item from an iterable list (Collection).

//Attribute Directives: Attribute directives are used to change the look and behavior 
//of the DOM elements.
 //For example: ngClass directive, and ngStyle directive etc.

//ngClass Directive: The ngClass directive is used to add or remove CSS 
//classes to an HTML element.

//ngStyle Directive: The ngStyle directive facilitates you to modify the
// style of an HTML element using the expression. 
//You can also use ngStyle directive to dynamically change the style of your HTML element.
